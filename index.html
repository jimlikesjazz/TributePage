        <p>Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington was born on the 29th April 1899 in Washington D.C.  He was a pianist, composer and bandleader from 1923 until his death aged 75 on May 24th 1974.
        </p>
        <p>Ellington was one of the most pivotal figures in jazz history, particularly in his inventive use of the jazz orchestra, and was known for his eloquence and charisma.</p>
        <p>Some of the greatest musicians in the idiom played with his orchestra, including: Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Jimmy Blanton, Paul Gonsalves, Ray Nance, Clark Terry and Cootie Williams.  Duke worked closely with composer and pianist Billy Strayhorn, who contributed many compositions and arrangements to the orchestra's songbook. </p>
        <p>Duke was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize Special Award for music in 1999.  His music is still performed throughout the world to this day.  In the U.S.A. there is a high school jazz band competition and festival entitled Essentially Ellington in which thousands of young musicians perform the music of Duke Ellington (and related composers) each year.</p>
